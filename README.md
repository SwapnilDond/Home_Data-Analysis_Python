This data analysis involved, obtaining column data types and descriptive statistics, converting results into a pandas DataFrame, generating box plots and scatter plots to illustrate linear relationships, applying simple and multiple linear regression models to assess performance using R^2 values. Additionally, a pipeline object was created for efficient model building, and a Ridge regression model was fitted with regularization to evaluate performance. Finally, a second-order polynomial transformation was performed on both training and testing data.
